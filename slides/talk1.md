- Chrome Extesions: Any standard HTML and Javascript editor can be used to create the extension. Chrome has a dedicated dashboard that can be used to point to the extension directory. Making changes to code requires hitting a reload button on the "Manage Extensions" to ensure that the latest code is running. 
	
- Firefox Add-ons: Firefox add-ons are built using the Jetpack project which provides an easy way to create add-ons for Firefox using HTML, CSS, and Javascript. Jetpack extensions are actually compiled to XPI which would mean compiling and reloading the extension.
