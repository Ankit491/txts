# Two Approaches

+ Chrome Extesions:
    + Uses JavaScript, HTML and CSS.
    + Based on Greasemonkey way of building things.
    + Making changes to code requires hitting a reload button on the "Manage Extensions" to ensure that the latest code is running. 
	
+ Firefox Add-ons: 
    + Uses Javascript, HTML and CSS.
    + Based on Jetpack project which provides an easy way to create add-ons for Firefox and it heavily borrows from CommonJS.
    + Jetpack extensions are actually compiled to XPI which would mean compiling and reloading the extension.
